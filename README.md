# TSH Academy - Next.js workshops app

This is an app used during Next.js workshops run by The Software House.

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, copy the `.env.dist` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## API

By default, [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) is used as a source of data. However, it is sometimes a little slow. Then we recommend running the server locally (link to the repository is in the documentation available above).
